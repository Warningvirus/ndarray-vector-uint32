## Introduction

The `ndarray-vector-uint32` library allows developers to work with unsigned 32-bit integer vectors in JavaScript. This is particularly useful for applications that require efficient numerical computations, such as data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. The library leverages the power of ndarrays to provide a simple and efficient interface for managing vectors.

## Installation

To install the library, you can use npm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install ndarray-vector-uint32
```

This will download the library and add it to your project's dependencies.

## Usage

After installation, you can easily create and manipulate unsigned 32-bit integer vectors. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```javascript
const createVector = require('ndarray-vector-uint32');

// Create a vector with initial values
const vec = createVector([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

// Access elements
console.log(vec.get(0)); // Output: 1

// Set elements
vec.set(0, 10);
console.log(vec.get(0)); // Output: 10
```

### Basic Operations

The library supports various operations on the vector. Here are a few common ones:

- **Get an element**: Use the `get(index)` method to retrieve an element at a specific index.
- **Set an element**: Use the `set(index, value)` method to update an element.
- **Length**: Use the `length` property to get the number of elements in the vector.

## Features

- **Simple API**: The library provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and manipulating unsigned 32-bit integer vectors.
- **Performance**: Built for speed, it is optimized for numerical computations.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Node.js and modern JavaScript environments.

## API Reference

### `createVector(array)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `array`: An array of unsigned 32-bit integers to initialize the vector.
- **Returns**: A new vector instance.

### `vec.get(index)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `index`: The index of the element to retrieve.
- **Returns**: The value at the specified index.

### `vec.set(index, value)`

- **Parameters**: 
  - `index`: The index of the element to update.
  - `value`: The new value to set.
- **Returns**: None.

### `vec.length`

- **Returns**: The number of elements in the vector.
